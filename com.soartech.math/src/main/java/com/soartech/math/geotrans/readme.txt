GEOTRANS 2.2.6

The GEOTRANS 2.2.5 software was developed and tested on Windows 2000, Solaris 7, Red Hat Linux Professional 9, and SuSE Linux 9.3 platforms, and should function correctly on more recent versions of those operating systems.

There are eight different GEOTRANS 2.2.6 distribution files - four for Windows, in zip format, and four for UNIX/Linux, in tar/gzip format:

win_user.zip - Windows end-user's package
win_dev.zip - Windows developer's package
master.zip - master copy (everything) in zip format
mgrs.zip - MGRS & supporting projections in zip format

unix_user.tgz - UNIX/Linux end-user's package
unix_dev.tgz - UNIX/Linux developer's package
master.tgz - master copy (everything) in tar/gzip format
mgrs.tgz - MGRS & supporting projections in tar/gzip

The Windows packages omit the UNIX/Linux-specific directories, while the UNIX/Linux packages omit the Windows-specific directories.

The end-user packages contain only executables, DLLs or shared object libraries, documentation, and supporting data.

The developer packages also include source code, as well as makefiles, MS Visual C++ workspace and project files, and everything else necessary to build the libraries and executables.  

The master packages can be considered to be cross-platform developer packages.  They both contain the union of the Windows and UNIX/Linux developer packages.  Only their format is different.  

The MGRS packages contain only the source code for the MGRS, UTM, UPS, Transverse Mercator, and Polar Stereographic conversion modules, and are intended for developers who only want to do MGRS conversions.  Their content is identical.  Only their format is different.

You should only need to copy one of these packages, depending on your platform and your intended usage.
